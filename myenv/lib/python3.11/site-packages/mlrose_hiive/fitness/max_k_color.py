class MaxKColor:
    """Fitness function for Max-k color optimization problem. Evaluates the
    fitness of an n-dimensional state vector
    :math:`x = [x_{0}, x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n-1}]`, where :math:`x_{i}`
    represents the color of node i, as the number of pairs of adjacent nodes
    of the same color.

    Parameters
    ----------
    edges: list of pairs
        List of all pairs of connected nodes. Order does not matter, so (a, b)
        and (b, a) are considered to be the same.

    Example
    -------
    .. highlight:: python
    .. code-block:: python

        >>> import mlrose_hiive
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> edges = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 4)]
        >>> fitness = mlrose_hiive.MaxKColor(edges)
        >>> state = np.array([0, 1, 0, 1, 1])
        >>> fitness.evaluate(state)
        3

    Note
    ----
    The MaxKColor fitness function is suitable for use in discrete-state
    optimization problems *only*.

    This is a cost minimization problem: lower scores are better than
    higher scores. That is, for a given graph, and a given number of colors,
    the challenge is to assign a color to each node in the graph such that
    the number of pairs of adjacent nodes of the same color is minimized.
